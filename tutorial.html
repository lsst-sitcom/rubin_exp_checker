      <p>The primary interface for the Exposure Checker is the <a href="viewer.html">Viewer</a>, which displays half of an LSST CCD.
      Initally three buttons are shown:</p>
      <button id="skip-button" class="btn btn-primary skip">Skip</button>
      <button id="fine-button" class="btn btn-success">Submit</button>
      <!--#include file="problem_selector.shtml"-->
      <p style="margin-top:10px">
      If you are quickly scanning through images without assessing them, press the <span class="text-info" style="font-weight: bold;">Skip</span> button to move to the next image.
      If there are no obvious issues with the image displayed, press <span class="text-success" style="font-weight: bold;">Submit</span> to flag the image as good.
      Otherwise, click the <span class="text-error" style="font-weight: bold;">Problem</span> button and select one of the predefined problem categories.
      Click on the location(s) of the problematic features to mark them on the image.</p>

      <p>In the course of marking problems, two new buttons will appear:</p>
      <div id="mark-buttons">
        <button class="btn btn-primary" data-toggle="button">False</button>
        <button class="btn btn-primary">Clear Last</button>
      </div>
      <p style="margin-top:10px">
      With the <span class="text-info" style="font-weight: bold;">False</span> button, you can report a non-existent problem that has been falsely flagged by data management (DM),
      e.g., a mask that covers an area that appears totally fine.
      Because DM interpolates over some features (cosmic rays, bleed trails, etc.) it can be very difficult to assess whether DM is performing properly.
      If you do determine that a mask was added in error, choose the appropriate mask category click on this button to report it.
      When you click on the image, a mark will appear to indicate that you are reporting a false positive.
      After you've marked the first problem, another button <span class="text-info" style="font-weight: bold;">Clear Last</span> will appear to let you undo your mark(s).
        Once you are done marking all problems, click <span class="text-success" style="font-weight:bold;">Submit</span> to log the problems and advance to the next image.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Exposure Checker provides a means to further investigate an image using these buttons:</p>

        The <span class="text-info" style="font-weight: bold;">Info</span> button opens a menu with a link to the image you are currently viewing, the path to the binned FITS file, and a PNG showing the entire focal plane field of view (FoV). You can also overlay problems previously reported for this image by other users.
        The <span class="text-info" style="font-weight: bold;">Toggle Mask</span> button allows you to turn on and off the image mask, while the <span class="text-info" style="font-weight: bold;">Toggle Scaling</span> button lets you change the image scaling.

      <h3>How to Check an Image</h3>
      <p> The Exposure Checker is most useful for discovering previously unknown issues in our data. We rely on you to train your own built-in neural network (i.e., brain) to be able to classify what is normal and abnormal in our images. While there isn't an exact perscription for how you check an image, below we list a few basic steps that you might consider.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Toggle the Scaling:</b> By toggling the scaling you can examine both bright and faint features in the image. The large stretch (darker background) images are good for identifying features like cosmic rays, while the small stretch (lighter background) is better for seeing background issues.</li>
        <li><b>Toggle the Mask:</b> The mask will display features that have already have been identified and corrected by DM. It will also allow you to identify over-agressive masking.</li>
        <li><b>Check Previously Marked Problems:</b> Checking problems marked by other users can be useful, especially if you are new to the exposure checker. That said, every cosmologist should recognize the power of blinding...</li>
        <li><b>Investigate the Focal Plane Image:</b> Take a look at the full focal plane FoV image. Often background mis-estimation can be more easly seen in the more heavily binned images. You can also use the FoV image to navigate to another CCD of interest, but be careful that this navigation will not submit your input for the current CCD.</li>
        <li><b>Mark Problems:</b> Mark issues that you find in the image. If you find something that doesn't seem to fit with known problem classes, add it as <span class="text-error" style="font-weight:bold;">"Other..."</span>. Remember to click on the image after entering text to mark <span class="text-error" style="font-weight:bold;">"Other..."</span> or <span class="text-error" style="font-weight:bold;">"Awesome"</span> features. You can mark multiple problems per image, but problems are not logged until you press <span class="text-success" style="font-weight:bold;">Submit</span>.</li>
        <li><b>Download the FITS File:</b> If you find something very strange, you can download the binned FITS file to investigate further with ds9. This is not necessary for most images; however, the header of this FITS file does provide useful metadata (i.e., telescope pointing, observing conditions, etc.)</li>
        <li><b>Submit Your Input:</b> Don't forget to click the <span class="text-success" style="font-weight:bold;">Submit</span> button! This is the only way to log your feedback on an image. If you don't want your feedback logged, you can press <span class="text-info" style="font-weight:bold;">Skip</span> instead, but this will not add to your score.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
      You should now have everything you need to start looking at images.
      If you still have questions, check out the <a href="faq.html">FAQ</a> page or post a message to <a href="https://lsstc.slack.com/messages/C932BQ550">#desc-dc-eyeballs</a>.
      The remainder of this tutorial goes into more detail about several common imaging artifacts. The <b>Simulation</b> section is geared towards issues in LSST DESC simulated images, while the other sections document common problems in real DES data.

      <h3>Simulation</h3>

      This section is for collecting feedback and issues on the simulation software. It is currently filled with problem classes (and examples) that were detected in DECam data from DES. Since we don't know exactly what issues we will run across with LSST, this section is open ended and evolving. If you see an issue that you don't know how to classify, mark it with "Other..." and report it on the <a href="https://lsstc.slack.com/messages/C932BQ550">#desc-dc2-eyeball</a> channel.

      <h4>Cosmic</h4>
      <p> Issues with cosmic ray generation and simulation. May include (but is not limited to) the number of cosmics simulated. The length of cosmic rays, the scattering rate, the sharpness of cosmic ray edges, filter dependence, etc.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="span7" >
      <a id="star-anchor"></a>
      <h4>Star</h4>
      <p> Issues with star generation and simulation. May include (but is not limited to): the size of stars, the brightnesses of stars, bleed trails from the saturation of stars. If you start to see consistent artifacts please add a new description in the "Other" classification.

    <div class="span7" >
      <a id="skybkg-anchor"></a>
      <h4>Sky background</h4>
      <p> Issues with sky background generation and simulation. May include (but is not limited to): the brightness, smoothness, and uniformity of the sky background. If you start to see consistent artifacts please add a new description in the "Other" classification.
      </p>

    <div class="span7" >
      <a id="instrument-anchor"></a>
      <h4>Instrument</h4>
      <p> Issues with how the instrument is simulated. May include (but is not limited to): incorrect camera/ccd geometry, incorrect reflections/scattered light, saturation effects (i.e., edge bleeds), electronic noise, etc. If you start to see consistent artifacts please add a new description in the "Other" classification.

      <h3>Masking</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="span7" >
      <a id="column-mask-anchor"></a>
      <h4>Column Mask</h4>
      <p> There are a number of columns that behave differently than their neighbors.
        Often this occurs when a hot pixel in the column bleeds over during readout.
        We attempt to mask these columns with a "bad pixel mask" and it is useful to know when we are missing bad columns.

    <div class="span7" >
      <a id="cosmic-ray-anchor"></a>
      <h4>Cosmic rays</h4>
      <p> Unmasked cosmic rays should become apparent when you use 
      <button class="btn btn-small btn-primary">Toggle s<u>c</u>aling</button>
      to switch to a scaling that emphasizes the bright aspects of the image and
      <button class="btn btn-small
      btn-primary">Toggle <u>m</u>ask</button> to blink the existing
      mask.  LSST DM interpolates masked cosmic ray pixels, which
      makes it difficult to identify over-agressive masking.

    <div class="span7">
      <a id="cross-talk-anchor"></a>
      <h4>Cross-talk</h4>
      <p>Cross-talk is a leakage of charge between electronic readout
      channels.  Cross-talk can usually be identified as long,
      vertical features, typically several pixels wide and
      often widest in the middle section.  Cross-talk is generally
      strongest between amplifiers on the same chip, and you should be
      able to find a bright object that is the source of the charge.
      Mark the widest region of the cross-talk feature (usually near the middle).

    <div class="span7">
      <a id="edge-bleed-anchor"></a>
      <h4>Edge-bleed</h4>
      <p> Very bright stars saturate the readout electronics leading
        to bright bleeds on the readout side of the CCD.  Edge-bleeds
        should be automatically identified and masked with a
        rectangular strip.  If this mask is too big, too small, or not
        present at all, please tag the location of the error.

    <div class="span7">
      <a id="excessive-mask-anchor"></a>
      <h4>Excessive mask</h4>
      <p> Occasionally large regions of a CCD get masked for no
        apparent reason. In LSST images, this is most commonly seen
        from over-agressive cosmic ray masking.  Toggle the mask and
        flag excessive masks when you see them.

    <div class="span7">
      <a id="dark-rim-anchor"></a>
      <h4>Dark rim</h4>
      <p> It is fairly common for dark regions to appear in the corners and around the edges of images.
        These reflect an over-subtraction of the sky background in these regions.
        These dark rims are often correlated with bright stars or dense fields.
      </p>

    <div class="span7">
      <a id="dark-halo-anchor"></a>
      <h4>Dark halo</h4>
      <p> Dark halos occasionally appear surrounding bright objects.
        This results from the sky background being over-estimated close to these objects.
      </p>

    <div class="span7">
      <a id="Quilted-sky-anchor"></a>
      <h4>Quilted sky</h4>
      <p> Occasionally images show strong rectilinear patterning, and in the worst cases a CCD will appear as a 4x8 quilt of light and dark regions.
        This quilting is introduced by a mismatch in the normalization factor between the pupil and illumination correction (both of which are calculated in 512 pixel blocks).
        This artifact often appears strongest near the sides of the CCD, and can manifest itself as a single vertical line inset by roughly 1/8th of a CCD length.

      <a id="wavy-sky-anchor"></a>
      <h4>Wavy sky</h4>
      <p> Wavy sky appears as large-scale structures contributing a high-level of sky background.
        These features are often correlated over the entire focal plane and can occur for several exposures in a row (they may be the result of poor observing conditions).
        We don't understand the root cause of this yet...

      <h4>Anti-bleed</h4>
      <p> Anti-bleeds are dark streaks extending from bright stars orthogonal to the readout direction.
        They have a width roughly comparable to the masked region of the star.
        They appear in the reduced images and are not purely an artifact of the sky background subtraction.

      <h4>Amp jump</h4>
      <p>The LSST CCDs are read out by 16 different amplifiers (8 per exposure checker image).
        The gains on these amplifiers are different leading to a different background level in different sections of each CCD.
        Differences between amplifiers should be corrected in processing; however, a failure can lead to a strong change in the background level at the amplifier boundaries.

      <h4>Fringing</h4>
      <p> Fringes are an interference pattern that occur at red wavelengths when the CCDs become transparent (think of the fringes on the surface of an oily puddle).
        Fringes are known to be variable (relative to the rest of sky brightness) and they can be difficult to deal with.
        They occur most commonly in the z- and y-bands.

      <h4>Tape bump</h4>
      <p> The silicon wafers are attached to the CCD backplanes by six pieces of double-sided tape (three along each long edge of the CCD).
        Physical stresses on the silicon lattice distort the electric field in these regions changing the effective size of the pixels in these regions.
        A failure in flat-fielding can lead to one or often more of these tape bumps being visible in the reduced image.

      <h4>Tree rings</h4>
      <p> Tree rings are concentric, circularly symmetric features arising changes in the effective pixel size resulting from transverse electric fields in the CCDs.
        Tree rings originate from variations in the doping impurities during single-crystal silicon growth.
        Thus, the tree ring pattern of each CCD will depend on its relative position in the silicon wafer.
        Tree rings appear most strongly in the z-band.

      <h4>Vertical jump</h4>
      <p>
        Vertical jumps can arises from the incorporation of a few bad flats into the calibration sets.
        These flats contain a strong gradient caused by the shutter failing to close during readout.
        Due to the clipping algorithm when combining multiple flats, this results in a vertical "jump" near the center of flat-fielded images.

      <h4>Bright spray</h4>
      <p> Light from bright off-axis stars can scatter at grazing incidence off of various surfaces in the optical train..
        This leads to broad bright sprays fanning out from the edge of the focal plane.
        These features can be most easily identified on the full focal plane images via the <button class="btn btn-small btn-primary">Info</button> button.

      <h4>Ghosts</h4>
      <p>Ghost are reflections off the internal camera optics.
        They dominantly appear when a bright object is in the field of view and often occupy very large areas (from parts of a chip to the entire focal plane).
        Small ghosts can be identified on a single chip by their characteristic "tie-fighter window" pattern; however, often it is helpful to look at images of the full focal play.

      <h4>Brush strokes</h4>
      <p> In addition to "Bright Sprays", less intense scattered light features appear on smaller scales.
        These have been termed "Brush Strokes" due to their diffuse, sweeping appearance.

      <a id="satellite-anchor"></a>
      <h4>Satellite</h4>
      <p>Satellite, orbital stages of rockets, and other reflecting bodies
      often cross our focal plane.
      They create long, unsaturated streaks on the images, much longer and wider than cosmic rays. Since they are so
      large, you can mark the track wherever you want. Sometimes, however,
      the tracks are broken into segments (note: <a href="http://www.satobs.org/tumble/tumbleintro.html">rocket parts may tumble</a>),
      in which case we'd like to have marks on each of the segments.
      In Y1A1, be sure to keep an eye out for falsely masked streaks (i.e., streak masks when no streak is present).

      <h4>Airplane</h4>
      <p> Unfortunately, CTIO lies along a regional Chilean airline flight path.
        We expect that roughly 15 planes will cross the DECam focal plane per season.
        Planes have a much larger impact that satellites, often destroying the sky background estimation.
        When lights on a airplane blink, they appear as out-of-focus donuts (and can be used to determine the height of the plane...).

        Star bleeds caused by shutter errors can be identified by looking at the full focal plane image, where the direction of the star bleeds will change between the top and bottom of the focal plane (due to a switch in the readout direction).
        Shutter errors should be solved by Year 2.

      <a id="vertical-stripes-anchor"></a>
      <h4>Vertical stripes</h4>
      <p> Some images contain a grainy vertical striping.
        Sometimes, this striping can be so bad that the image gets excessively masked.
        Vertical striping can be caused by a loose sync cable influencing the readout electronics.
        The root cause can be both the individual images or the bias frame that is subtracted from each raw image.
        Vertical striping is known to affect exposures taken in November, 2013 (specifically, CCDs on backplane 1).
