    <div class="span12">
      <p>The primary interface for the Exposure Checker is the <a href="viewer.html">Viewer</a>, which displays half of an LSST CCD.
      Initally three buttons are shown:</p>
      <button id="skip-button" class="btn btn-primary skip">Skip</button>
      <button id="fine-button" class="btn btn-success">Submit</button>
      <!--#include file="problem_selector.shtml"-->
      <p style="margin-top:10px">
      If you are quickly scanning through images without assessing them, press the <span style="font-weight: bold; color:#006dcc">Skip</span> button to move to the next image.
      If there are no obvious issues with the image displayed, press <span style="font-weight: bold; color:#46a546">Submit</span> to flag the image as good.
      Otherwise, click the <span style="font-weight: bold; color:#9d261d">Problem</span> button and select one of the predefined problem categories.
      Click on the location(s) of the problematic features to mark them on the image.</p>

      <p>In the course of marking problems, two new buttons will appear:</p>
      <div id="mark-buttons">
        <button class="btn btn-primary" data-toggle="button">False</button>
        <button class="btn btn-primary">Clear Last</button>
      </div>
      <p style="margin-top:10px">
      With the <span style="font-weight: bold; color:#006dcc">False</span> button, you can report a non-existent problem that has been falsely flagged by data management (DM),
      e.g. a mask that covers an area that appears totally fine.
      Because DM interpolates over some features (cosmic rays, bleed trails, etc.) it can be very difficult to assess whether DM is performing properly.
      If you do determine that a mask was added in error, choose the appropriate mask category click on this button to report it.
      When you click on the image, a mark will appear to indicate that you are reporting a false positive.
      After you've marked the first problem, another button <span style="font-weight: bold; color:#006dcc">Clear Last</span> will appear to let you undo your mark(s).
        Once you are done marking all problems, click <span style="font-weight: bold; color:#46a546">Submit</span> to log the problems and advance to the next image.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Exposure Checker provides a means to further investigate an image using these buttons:</p>
      <p>
      <div class="btn-group">

      <button class="btn btn-primary">Toggle s<u>c</u>aling</button>
      </p>
      <p>
        The <span style="font-weight: bold; color:#006dcc">Info</span> button opens a menu with a link to the image you are currently viewing, the path to the full resolution FITS file, and a PNG showing the entire focal plane. You can also overlay problems previously reported for this image by other users.
        The <span style="font-weight: bold; color:#006dcc">Toggle Mask</span> button allows you to turn on and off the image mask, while the <span style="font-weight: bold; color:#006dcc">Toggle Scaling</span> button lets you change the image scaling.
      </p>
      <p>
      You now have everything you need to start looking at images.
      If you still have questions, go the <a href="faq.html">FAQ</a> page and see if we cover it already.<br>
      The remainder of this tutorial goes into more detail about several common imaging artifacts. The <b>Simulation</b> section is geared towards issues in LSST DESC simulated images, while the other sections document common problems in real DES data.

      <h2>Simulation</h2>

      This section is for collecting feedback and issues on the simulation software. It is currently filled with problem classes (and examples) that were detected in DECam data from DES. Since we don't know exactly what issues we will run across with LSST, this section is open ended and evolving. If you see an issue that you don't know how to classify, mark it with "Other..." and report it on the <a href="https://lsstc.slack.com/messages/C932BQ550">#desc-dc2-eyeball</a> channel.

      <h2>Masking</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="span7" >
      <a id="column-mask-anchor"></a>
      <h4>Column Mask</h4>
      <p> There are a number of columns that behave differently than their neighbors.
        Often this occurs when a hot pixel in the column bleeds over during readout.
        We attempt to mask these columns with a "bad pixel mask" and it is useful to know when we are missing bad columns.
      </p>

    <div class="span7" >
      <a id="cosmic-ray-anchor"></a>
      <h4>Cosmic rays</h4>
      <p> Unmasked cosmic rays should become apparent when you use 
      <button class="btn btn-small btn-primary">Toggle s<u>c</u>aling</button>
      to switch to a scaling that emphasizes the bright aspects of the image and
      <button class="btn btn-small
      btn-primary">Toggle <u>m</u>ask</button> to blink the existing
      mask.  LSST DM interpolates masked cosmic ray pixels, which
      makes it difficult to identify over-agressive masking.

    <div class="span7">
      <a id="cross-talk-anchor"></a>
      <h4>Cross-talk</h4>
      <p>Cross-talk is a leakage of charge between electronic readout
      channels.  Cross-talk can usually be identified as long,
      vertical features, typically several pixels wide and
      often widest in the middle section.  Cross-talk is generally
      strongest between amplifiers on the same chip, and you should be
      able to find a bright object that is the source of the charge.
      Mark the widest region of the cross-talk feature (usually near the middle).

    <div class="span7">
      <a id="edge-bleed-anchor"></a>
      <h4>Edge-bleed</h4>
      <p> Very bright stars saturate the readout electronics leading
        to bright bleeds on the readout side of the CCD.  Edge-bleeds
        should be automatically identified and masked with a
        rectangular strip.  If this mask is too big, too small, or not
        present at all, please tag the location of the error.

      <h4>Excessive mask</h4>
      <p> Occasionally large regions of a CCD get masked for no
        apparent reason. In LSST images, this is most commonly seen
        from over-agressive cosmic ray masking.  Toggle the mask and
        flag excessive masks when you see them.

      <h2>Sky Estimation</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="span7">
      <a id="dark-rim-anchor"></a>
      <h4>Dark rim</h4>
      <p> It is fairly common for dark regions to appear in the corners and around the edges of images.
        These reflect an over-subtraction of the sky background in these regions.
        These dark rims are often correlated with bright stars or dense fields.
      </p>

    <div class="span7">
      <a id="dark-halo-anchor"></a>
      <h4>Dark halo</h4>
      <p> Dark halos occasionally appear surrounding bright objects.
        This results from the sky background being over-estimated close to these objects.
      </p>

    </div>

    <div class="span7">
      <a id="Quilted-sky-anchor"></a>
      <h4>Quilted sky</h4>
      <p> Occasionally images show strong rectilinear patterning, and in the worst cases a CCD will appear as a 4x8 quilt of light and dark regions.
        This quilting is introduced by a mismatch in the normalization factor between the pupil and illumination correction (both of which are calculated in 512 pixel blocks).
        This artifact often appears strongest near the sides of the CCD, and can manifest itself as a single vertical line inset by roughly 1/8th of a CCD length.
      </p>

    <div class="span7">
      <a id="wavy-sky-anchor"></a>
      <h4>Wavy sky</h4>
      <p> Wavy sky appears as large-scale structures contributing a high-level of sky background.
        These features are often correlated over the entire focal plane and can occur for several exposures in a row (they may be the result of poor observing conditions).
        We don't understand the root cause of this yet...

      <a id="anti-bleed-anchor"></a>
      <h4>Anti-bleed</h4>
      <p> Anti-bleeds are dark streaks extending from bright stars orthogonal to the readout direction.
        They have a width roughly comparable to the masked region of the star.
        They appear in the reduced images and are not purely an artifact of the sky background subtraction.

      <a id="ab-jump-anchor"></a>
      <h4>Amp jump</h4>
      <p>The LSST CCDs are read out by 16 different amplifiers (8 per exposure checker image).
        The gains on these amplifiers are different leading to a different background level in different sections of each CCD.
        Differences between amplifiers should be corrected in processing; however, a failure can lead to a strong change in the background level at the amplifier boundaries.

      <a id="fringing-anchor"></a>
      <h4>Fringing</h4>
      <p> Fringes are an interference pattern that occur at red wavelengths when the CCDs become transparent (think of the fringes on the surface of an oily puddle).
        Fringes are known to be variable (relative to the rest of sky brightness) and they can be difficult to deal with.
        They occur most commonly in the z- and y-bands.

      <a id="tape-bump-anchor"></a>
      <h4>Tape bump</h4>
      <p> The silicon wafers are attached to the CCD backplanes by six pieces of double-sided tape (three along each long edge of the CCD).
        Physical stresses on the silicon lattice distort the electric field in these regions changing the effective size of the pixels in these regions.
        A failure in flat-fielding can lead to one or often more of these tape bumps being visible in the reduced image.

      <a id="tree-rings-anchor"></a>
      <h4>Tree rings</h4>
      <p> Tree rings are concentric, circularly symmetric features arising changes in the effective pixel size resulting from transverse electric fields in the CCDs.
        Tree rings originate from variations in the doping impurities during single-crystal silicon growth.
        Thus, the tree ring pattern of each CCD will depend on its relative position in the silicon wafer.
        Tree rings appear most strongly in the z-band.

      <a id="vertical-jump-anchor"></a>
      <h4>Vertical jump</h4>
      <p>
        Vertical jumps can arises from the incorporation of a few bad flats into the calibration sets.
        These flats contain a strong gradient caused by the shutter failing to close during readout.
        Due to the clipping algorithm when combining multiple flats, this results in a vertical "jump" near the center of flat-fielded images.

      <h4>Bright spray</h4>
      <p> Light from bright off-axis stars can scatter at grazing incidence off of various surfaces in the optical train..
        This leads to broad bright sprays fanning out from the edge of the focal plane.
        These features can be most easily identified on the full focal plane images via the <button class="btn btn-small btn-primary">Info</button> button.

      <p>Ghost are reflections off the internal camera optics.
        They dominantly appear when a bright object is in the field of view and often occupy very large areas (from parts of a chip to the entire focal plane).
        Small ghosts can be identified on a single chip by their characteristic "tie-fighter window" pattern; however, often it is helpful to look at images of the full focal play.

      <h4>Satellite</h4>
      <p>Satellite, orbital stages of rockets, and other reflecting bodies
      often cross our focal plane.
      They create long, unsaturated streaks on the images, much longer and wider than cosmic rays. Since they are so
      large, you can mark the track wherever you want. Sometimes, however,
      the tracks are broken into segments (note: <a href="http://www.satobs.org/tumble/tumbleintro.html">rocket parts may tumble</a>),
      in which case we'd like to have marks on each of the segments.
      In Y1A1, be sure to keep an eye out for falsely masked streaks (i.e., streak masks when no streak is present).

      <h4>Airplane</h4>
      <p> Unfortunately, CTIO lies along a regional Chilean airline flight path.
        We expect that roughly 15 planes will cross the DECam focal plane per season.
        Planes have a much larger impact that satellites, often destroying the sky background estimation.
        When lights on a airplane blink, they appear as out-of-focus donuts (and can be used to determine the height of the plane...).

      <a id="guiding-anchor"></a>
      <h4>Guiding Failure</h4>
      <p> Failures in the telescope guiding can lead to extended and elongated sources.
        These issues will hopefully be solved in Year 1.

      <a id="shutter-anchor"></a>
      <h4>Shutter Failure</h4>
      <p> Star bleeds are often symptomatic of the camera being readout with the shutter still open.
        Star bleeds caused by shutter errors can be identified by looking at the full focal plane image, where the direction of the star bleeds will change between the top and bottom of the focal plane (due to a switch in the readout direction).
        Shutter errors should be solved by Year 2.

      <p>There are additional readout glitches, which are usually manifest as nearly vertical hatched lines near the edges of the CCDs.
        These issues should be fixed early in SV.

      <h4>Haze</h4>
      <p> Haze appears as large diffuse blurs around bright objects.
      It affects the entire focal plane and can thus be seen well from the FoV images.
      The reason could be a slightly overcast sky, but we don't fully understand the root cause of this yet...

    <div class="span7">
      <a id="vertical-stripes-anchor"></a>
      <h4>Vertical stripes</h4>
      <p> Some images contain a grainy vertical striping.
        Sometimes, this striping can be so bad that the image gets excessively masked.
        Vertical striping can be caused by a loose sync cable influencing the readout electronics.
        The root cause can be both the individual images or the bias frame that is subtracted from each raw image.
        Vertical striping is known to affect exposures taken in November, 2013 (specifically, CCDs on backplane 1).
