      <h3>Why can't I submit my responses?</h3>
      <p>Check that you are logged into the authenticated NERSC portal (i.e., <a href="https://portal-auth.nersc.gov">https://portal-auth.nersc.gov</a>). If the URL in your browser start with <a href="https://portal.nersc.gov">https://portal.nersc.gov</a> instead then you are not properly authenticated and your submissions will not be recorded.

      <a id="mask-anchor"></a>
      <h3>What do the mask colors mean?</h3>
      <p>The LSST Science Pipelines store information about why a pixel is masked in a "bit mask plane", and we color the mask based on the highest bit in this plane. We try to follow the Science Pipelines convention for mapping colors to mask bits, which can be found <a href="https://pipelines.lsst.io/getting-started/display.html#interpreting-displayed-mask-colors">here</a>.

      <h3>Why doesn't the password work?</h3>
      <p>It does, otherwise you wouldn't be able to see this page. You can browse all pages
      and load any image in our database into the viewer. But if you want to
      submit problems you see in these images, you need your own account for this website.
      Go to the <a href="index.html">start page</a> and create it, it's very straightforward.<br>
      And don't worry if you see something worthwhile reporting, but then have to login first:
      we'll bring you back to that image after you've logged in or signed up.

      <h3>What happens with my submissions?</h3>
      <p>Your submissions are recorded each time you click the <button class="btn btn-small btn-success">Submit</button> button.
        It's not a problem if you missed something on the image or you hit the button accidentially, since we don't have to be complete in finding problems. 
        We do seek to be reliable when we state that something is problematic.

    <div class="span12">
      <a id="false-positives-anchor"></a>
      <h3>False positives vs false negatives?</h3>
      <p>We would like to know about any kind of flaw in the data. Therefore, please
      mark both false negative and false positive instances of artifacts
      (e.g., use "Edge Bleed" to mark both an edge bleed without an edge bleed
      mask and a edge bleed mask without an edge bleed).
      We provide a <button class="btn btn-primary btn-small" data-toggle="button">False</button> button,
      that allows you to report a false-positive treatment of such a problem.

      <a id="underlined-letters-anchor"></a>
      <h3>What's up with the underlined letters on buttons?</h3>
      <p>Any underlined letter on a button indicates that you can use a keyboard shortcut. In the two cases below, you can use <strong>Alt+m</strong>
        to toggle the mask and  <strong>Alt+s</strong> to toggle the scaling.
        <span class="muted">Hint for Mac users: Alt = Option</span>

    <div class="span12">
      <a id="dotted-columns-anchor"></a>
      <h3>What are those dots in the column masks?</h3>
      <p> Very hot pixels will overflow into downstream pixels during readout creatig a "bad column".
        Additionally, cross talk creates hot pixels spaced every 60 pixels upstream (towards the readout side) of the hot pixels.
        This appears as a dotted mask upstream of a truncated bad column mask.
        These dots are not actually a problem class.

    <div class="span12">
        <a id="asymmetric-bleed-trails"></a>
        <h3>Why are some of the bleed trails one-sided?</h3>
        <p> Bleed trails result when a bright object saturates one or
            more pixels and charge overflows along the readout
            direction. There is a barrier between the top and bottom of
            the e2v sensors that stops charge from flowing between the
            two halves of the CCD.
            This causes some of the bleed trails to appear asymmetric
            depending on their position in the channel and the amount
            of charge overflow.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="span12">
      <a id="no-image-anchor"></a>
      <h3>I can't see the images. What's wrong?</h3>
      <p>Very likely your browser doesn't support the way we load the images. 
        Safari version 5 is an example for this lack of implementation of a nominally supported functionality.
      In this case, please use another/newer browser instead.
      </p>

    <!--
    <div class="span12">
      <a id="star-mask-anchor"></a>
      <h3>Are stars being masked properly?</h3>
      <p> The intention of the current star masking is to mask only the most problematic pixels.
      This includes the saturated pixels at the center of stars, a circular region surrounding bright stars,
      and horizontal "bleed-trails" that are saturated along the readout direction. Currently diffraction
      spikes and Y-band vertical spikes are not explicitly dealt with by the star masking software.
      The satellite track finder has been tweaked a bit in an attempt to mask the worst diffraction spikes,
      but the effectiveness of this remains to be seen.
